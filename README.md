# News-Automated-Email-using-Python
  1. This is my first project in Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup library of Python.
  2. I have uploaded both the Python code as well as the Jupyter Notebook file in the repository.
  3. If you want to use this script, then you can use it but before using it, you have to do some changes in the script.
      1. Enter the "FROM" email address in the script.
      2. Enter the "TO" email address in the script.
      3. Enter the "FROM" email address Password in "PASS".
  4. After this you are good to go and run this Python file.
  5. I would like to thank to "https://www.freecodecamp.org/" (for helping me in learning Python libraries used in this project) and "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india" (for scraping the news from TOI website).
